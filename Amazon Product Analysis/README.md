"Amazon Sales" from Kaggle

## QUESTIONS ANALYZED

- What is the total listed discounted value of products?
- Which products have the highest customer engagement?
- Which categories have the highest average ratings?
- Do higher discounts correlate with higher customer ratings?
  
## KEY INSIGHTS
Diverse Products: This dataset provides a diverse list of products across multiple categories. This provides meaningful analysis of prices, ratings, discounts, and customer engagement.

Product engagement: Some product categories have higher engagement as seen through the number of reviews compared to other categories. This suggests certain products have higher customer interaction despite price 

Discounts do not guarantee higher ratings: Analysis of discount levels shows products with a higher average discount do not consistently receive higher ratings. This shows that higher discounts alone are not enough to influence customer perception
